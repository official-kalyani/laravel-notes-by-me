### React App Walkthrough

### Create React App

1. **Create a new React app:** 
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app using Create React App without installing it globally:
npx create-react-app your-app-name
Replace "your-app-name" with the desired name for your React app.
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** 
Change into the newly created app directory using the following command:
cd your-app-name

Run the development server: Start the development server to see your React app in action. Run the following command:
npm start
This will start the development server and open your app in a new browser window.


createRoot Function

The createRoot function is part of React's Concurrent Mode API, introduced to enable smoother user experiences by allowing React to work on multiple tasks concurrently. It is used to create a root in the React tree where concurrent rendering can take place. Concurrent Mode is an experimental set of features in React that may undergo changes in future releases.



import React, { createRoot } from 'react';

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';



// Create a root with createRoot

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));



// Concurrently render a component

const App = () => (

<div>

<h1>Hello, React Concurrent Mode!</h1>

</div>

);



// Render the component within the root

root.render(<App />);

JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX provides a more concise and readable syntax for defining the structure of React components. It looks similar to XML or HTML but is actually a syntactic sugar for React.createElement calls.



Functional Component

A functional component in React is a simple JavaScript function that returns JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the structure of the UI. Functional components are often referred to as "stateless components" because they don't have internal state or lifecycle methods



export default

In JavaScript (and also in React), the export default syntax is used to export a single "default" value or function from a module. This allows you to import that value or function without using curly braces {} when importing it in another module.



Creating Components in React

Create a new file for your component: Start by creating a new JavaScript or JSX file for your component. Let's say you want to create a basic functional component named MyComponent.



// MyComponent.js

import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {

return (

<div>

<p>This is my component!</p>

</div>

);

};

export default MyComponent;

Use the component in another file: You can then use this component in another file by importing it:

// App.js

import React from 'react';

import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

const App = () => {

return (

<div>

<h1>Hello, React App!</h1>

<MyComponent />

</div>

);

};

export default App;
