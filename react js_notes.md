### React App Walkthrough

### Create React App

1. **Create a new React app:** 
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app using Create React App without installing it globally:
> npx create-react-app your-app-name
> Replace "your-app-name" with the desired name for your React app.
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** 
Change into the newly created app directory using the following command:
> cd your-app-name

3. **Run the development server:**
 Start the development server to see your React app in action. Run the following command:
 > npm start
 > This will start the development server and open your app in a new browser window.


<ins> **createRoot Function** </ins>

The createRoot function is part of React's Concurrent Mode API, introduced to enable smoother user experiences by allowing React to work on multiple tasks concurrently. It is used to create a root in the React tree where concurrent rendering can take place. Concurrent Mode is an experimental set of features in React that may undergo changes in future releases.


```
import React, { createRoot } from 'react';

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';



// Create a root with createRoot

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));



// Concurrently render a component

const App = () => (

<div>

<h1>Hello, React Concurrent Mode!</h1>

</div>

);



// Render the component within the root

root.render(<App />);
```
<ins> **JSX** </ins>

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX provides a more concise and readable syntax for defining the structure of React components. It looks similar to XML or HTML but is actually a syntactic sugar for React.createElement calls.



<ins> **Functional Component** </ins>

A functional component in React is a simple JavaScript function that returns JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the structure of the UI. Functional components are often referred to as "stateless components" because they don't have internal state or lifecycle methods



<ins> **export default** </ins>

In JavaScript (and also in React), the export default syntax is used to export a single "default" value or function from a module. This allows you to import that value or function without using curly braces {} when importing it in another module.



<ins> **Creating Components in React** </ins>

Create a new file for your component: Start by creating a new JavaScript or JSX file for your component. Let's say you want to create a basic functional component named MyComponent.


```
// MyComponent.js

import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {

return (

<div>

<p>This is my component!</p>

</div>

);

};

export default MyComponent;

```
**Use the component in another file:** You can then use this component in another file by importing it:
```
// App.js

import React from 'react';

import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

const App = () => {

return (

<div>

<h1>Hello, React App!</h1>

<MyComponent />

</div>

);

};

export default App;
```

### Document Object Model ( DOM )

DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of HTML or XML documents as a tree-like model where each node represents a part of the document. The DOM provides a way for programs to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of web pages.

### Virtual DOM

The Virtual DOM is a concept used in various frontend libraries and frameworks, notably React.js, to optimize the performance of web applications by minimizing the number of direct manipulations to the actual DOM. It works by maintaining a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM known as the virtual DOM.

There are 2 important concepts used by which React handles creation of DOM,

1. **Reconciliation**

>Reconciliation in React is the process by which the framework efficiently updates the user interface in response to changes in application state. This mechanism revolves around React's Virtual DOM, a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. When a component's state changes, React re-renders the component and its children, comparing the new Virtual DOM with the previous one through a diffing algorithm. This comparison identifies the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM, ensuring optimal performance by only applying necessary updates. Reconciliation plays a crucial role in enhancing the responsiveness and efficiency of React applications, abstracting away the complexities of DOM manipulation and providing developers with a streamlined approach to building dynamic user interfaces.



2. **Diffing Algorithm**

>The diffing algorithm in React is a core mechanism responsible for efficiently updating the user interface by identifying the minimal set of changes needed to reconcile the Virtual DOM with the actual DOM. When a component's state changes, React re-renders the component and its children, generating a new Virtual DOM tree. The diffing algorithm then compares this new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one, recursively traversing both trees to identify any differences in their structure or content. By strategically analyzing the changes, such as additions, removals, or updates of elements, React determines the most efficient way to update the actual DOM. This process helps minimize unnecessary updates, optimizing performance and ensuring a responsive user experience in React applications.

### JSX
>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML and is commonly used with React to describe the structure of UI components. JSX provides a more concise and readable syntax for defining the structure of React components compared to using plain JavaScript.

Here's a basic example of JSX in a React component:
```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {

const name = 'John';



return (

<div>

<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>

<p>This is a JSX example in React.</p>

</div>

);

};

export default MyComponent;
```
**Embedding a JavaScript variable**
>In JSX, you can embed JavaScript variables by wrapping them in curly braces {}. This allows you to dynamically insert values into your JSX code.

Here's an example:
```
import React from 'react';



const MyComponent = () => {

const name = 'John';

const age = 25;



return (

<div>

<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>

<p>You are {age} years old.</p>

</div>

);

};



export default MyComponent;
```
In this example, the variables name and age are JavaScript variables, and they are inserted into the JSX by enclosing them in curly braces. The resulting JSX will display the values of these variables when rendered.

**Closing Tag in JSX**
>In React, it is crucial to close tags properly because JSX follows the XML/HTML syntax rules. JSX is a syntactic sugar for React.createElement, and it enforces a strict XML/HTML-like syntax. Therefore, JSX elements must be properly closed, just like in HTML.

```
import React from 'react';



const BuggyComponent = () => {

return (

<div>

<h1>Buggy React Component</h1>

{/* Incorrect: The <img> tag is not properly closed */}

<img src="..." alt="A sample image">

</div>

);

};



export default BuggyComponent;
```
In the above example, you will likely encounter a syntax error during the compilation phase. The error occurs because the JSX syntax is not valid due to the unclosed <img> tag.

### Functional Component
>A functional component in React is a JavaScript function that takes props as an argument and returns JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the UI. Functional components are also sometimes referred to as "stateless components" because they don't have internal state or lifecycle methods. With the introduction of Hooks in React, functional components can now manage state and have access to other features that were traditionally available only in class components.

```
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponent = (props) => {

return (

<div>

<h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>

<p>This is a functional component in React.</p>

</div>

);

};



export default FunctionalComponent;
```
**Requirement of Functional Components**

>Functional components in React are crucial for their simplicity, readability, and versatility, especially with the introduction of Hooks. They offer a concise way to define components, making code more maintainable and promoting functional programming principles. The absence of lifecycle methods by default makes them straightforward, and the addition of Hooks empowers functional components to manage state and side effects, eliminating the need for class components solely for these purposes. This paradigm shift simplifies testing, improves performance, and fosters a consistent coding style, contributing to a more streamlined and modular React codebase.

**Styling in Components**

>Styling in React components can be approached in various ways, depending on your project's requirements and personal preferences. Here are a few common methods for styling React components:



>Inline Styles: You can apply styles directly to JSX elements using inline styles. Styles are defined as JavaScript objects and assigned using the style attribute. This method is useful for small-scale styling but may become cumbersome for larger projects.

```
const MyComponent = () => {

const styles = {

color: 'blue',

fontSize: '16px',

};

return <div style={styles}>Styled content</div>;

};
```
**CSS Stylesheets:**
>You can create separate CSS files and import them into your components. This approach keeps styles separate from your component logic, promoting better organization. Use class names to apply styles to JSX elements.

```
.myComponent {

color: blue;

font-size: 16px;

}



// MyComponent.js

import React from 'react';

import './styles.css';



const MyComponent = () => {

return <div className="myComponent">Styled content</div>;

};
```
**Props**
>In React, "props" (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They allow you to make your components dynamic and reusable by providing a mechanism for communication between different parts of your application.
```
// ParentComponent.js

import React from 'react';

import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';



const ParentComponent = () => {

const message = "Hello from the parent component!";



return <ChildComponent greeting={message} />;

};



export default ParentComponent;

// ChildComponent.js

import React from 'react';



const ChildComponent = (props) => {

return <p>{props.greeting}</p>;

};



export default ChildComponent;
```
>In this example, the ParentComponent passes the greeting prop to the ChildComponent. Props are accessed in the child component function through the props argument.
>Props can be used to make components more dynamic and customizable. They are often used to pass data, event handlers, or configuration options from a parent to a child component. Additionally, props can be used to conditionally render content based on different values.


### Rendering List and conditional Rendering

**Introduction**
>React developers can use conditional rendering to control component visibility and behavior based on certain conditions. Whether it's rendering different content based on user authentication, handling loading states, or displaying components dynamically, mastering conditional rendering is essential for building robust React applications. In this article, we'll explore various techniques for conditional rendering in React along with sample code to illustrate each method.

>There are three ways to implement conditional rendering in React.

1. Using if else Statement
2. Using ternary operator
3. Using Logical && Operator

**Using if-else statement**
>One of the simplest ways to conditionally render content in React is by using if/else statements within the component's render method. Developers can define conditions based on props, state, or any other variables and render different content accordingly. This approach is intuitive and works well for simple scenarios.

**Syntax**
```
function MainComponent(props) {
    const myBool = props.myBool;
    if (myBool) {
        return <Component1/>;
    } else{
        return <Component2/>;
    }
}
```
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ConditionalRendering extends Component {
  render() {
    const isLoggedIn = this.props.isLoggedIn;

    if (isLoggedIn) {
      return <WelcomeMessage />;
    } else {
      return <LoginPrompt />;
    }
  }
}

const WelcomeMessage = () => {
  return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
};

const LoginPrompt = () => {
  return <h1>Please log in to continue.</h1>;
};

export default ConditionalRendering;
```
**Using ternary operator**
>The ternary operator is a concise way to express conditional logic in React components. It consists of a condition followed by a question mark (?), a value to return if the condition is true, and a value to return if the condition is false. This method is often used for rendering components conditionally based on a single condition.
```
import React from 'react';

const ConditionalRendering = ({ isLoggedIn }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? (
        <WelcomeMessage />
      ) : (
        <LoginPrompt />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

const WelcomeMessage = () => {
  return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
};

const LoginPrompt = () => {
  return <h1>Please log in to continue.</h1>;
};

export default ConditionalRendering;
```
**Using Logical && Operator**
>The logical && operator is another compact way to conditionally render elements in React. It evaluates the expression on its left-hand side and, if true, renders the element on its right-hand side. This technique is particularly useful for rendering components based on boolean conditions.
```
import React from 'react';

const ConditionalRendering = ({ isLoggedIn }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn && <WelcomeMessage />}
      {!isLoggedIn && <LoginPrompt />}
    </div>
  );
};

const WelcomeMessage = () => {
  return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
};

const LoginPrompt = () => {
  return <h1>Please log in to continue.</h1>;
};

export default ConditionalRendering;
```
**Advantages of using conditional rendering**
1. Dynamic Content: Conditional rendering allows developers to display content dynamically based on specific conditions. This enables the creation of dynamic user interfaces that adapt to different states and user interactions, enhancing user engagement and usability.
2. Improved User Experience: By showing or hiding elements based on conditions, conditional rendering helps improve the overall user experience. Whether it's displaying loading indicators during data fetching or showing error messages when an operation fails, conditional rendering enhances user feedback and reduces confusion.
3. Reduced Complexity: Conditional rendering simplifies the logic of rendering components by eliminating the need for manual DOM manipulation or complex if/else statements. This leads to cleaner and more maintainable code, reducing development time and effort.
4. Enhanced Performance: Rendering only the necessary components based on conditions can improve application performance. By avoiding unnecessary rendering cycles, conditional rendering helps optimize performance, especially in large-scale applications, resulting in faster load times and smoother interactions.
5. Customization and Personalization: Conditional rendering enables developers to customize the user interface based on user preferences, roles, or other contextual factors. This enables personalized experiences for individual users or segments, increasing satisfaction and retention.
